    <h1>Making Do in Standard-Width Shoes</h1>
    <p>a guide for men with narrow feet</p>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>When you can’t <a href="/">find shoes sized for your narrow feet</a>, you may get stuck making do in wider shoes. There are two basic approaches you can try, alone and in combination.</p>
    <p>There is also the issue of arch height.  A shoe that’s too wide for you won’t necessarily be too tall, as well. But height problems can come along with width problems,  esepcially for those with short, narrow feet, and in standard-width shoes designed for high arches.</p>
    <h2 id="socks">Socks</h2>
    <p>Take up the difference between narrow foot and wider shoe by making the foot wider.</p>
    <p>Small gaps can be filled with cushioned socks. With the right material, such as merino wool, thicker socks won’t necessarily sweat your foot, even in temperate weather.</p>
    <p>Increasing the whole volume of the foot to address a width problem may crowding in the other dimensions, length and height. A shoe that's already tight around your arch, such as well fitting Wellington or Western boot, may become too tight. A shoe that's just long enough for your toes with thin socks may crowd you toes in thicker ones.</p>
    <p>Some sock makers, like <a href="https://darntough.com/">Darn Tough</a>, offer cushioned socks in a variety of patterns with different thicknesses of cushion on different parts of the foot. If a fully cushioned sock causes tightness in a particular area, you might try a different sock without cushioning around that area.</p>
    <h2 id="insoles">Insoles</h2>
    <p>Take up the difference in width by propping the foot higher up in the shoe, where it’s narrower.</p>
    <p>Seen straight on, toe to heel, nearly all uppers are dome shaped, narrowing toward the top of the vamp and the quarters. Adding a foam or leather insert beneath the foot, or replacing any factory insole with a thicker one, effectively raises the foot to a narrower depth within the shoe.</p>
    <p>Depending on the shape of the shoe, especially the width and height of the toe box, raising the foot in the shoe may create issues in other dimensions, much as with thick socks. Some work around this using inserts only as long as the heel and arch, or by cutting full-length inserts off at the toes.</p>
    <h2 id="tongues">False Tongues / Kilties</h2>
    <p>In laced shoes and especially work boots, take up empty space above the instep by lacing a piece of leather between the tongue and the eyelet runs of the quarters.</p>
    <p>This also spreads apart eyelets that may have been touching, enabling the laces to pull snug on the top of the foot again.</p>
