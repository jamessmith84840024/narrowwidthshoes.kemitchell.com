This page lists companies offering shoes and boots in narrow mens sizes.  If you know of a company not listed here or spot an error, [e-mail me about it at kyle@kemitchell.com](mailto:kyle@kemitchell.com?subject=Narrow-Width%20Shoes).

Note that the standard womens width is often the same as mens narrow, often "B" in US sizing.  Unless your feet are longer than the whole womens range---if often helps to compare EU sizes, which are unisex---you might find a womens size that fits you perfectly.  Just beware of subtle changes between mens and womens models.  Companies sometimes skimp on womens versions.
