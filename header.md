This page lists companies offering shoes and boots in narrow mens widths. If you know of a company not listed here, [e-mail me about it at kyle@kemitchell.com](mailto:kyle@kemitchell.com?subject=Narrow-Width%20Shoes).

Note that the standard womens width is often the same B as mens narrow. Unless your feet are longer than the whole womens range, you might find a womens size that fits you ideally. Just beware of subtle changes between mens and womens models. Companies sometimes skimp on womens versions.
